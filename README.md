# pdr-tests
This repository contains the testing suite / toolchain for [pdr](https://github.com/MillionConcepts/pdr). This software is at functional alpha status and in active use for both development and regression testing. You may do almost anything you want with it, subject to the extremely permissive terms of the BSD 3-Clause License. However, no documentation is presently available, so we do not particularly recommend its use to external parties: caveat emptor.

The `ix` user guide is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ERwsHvYKMYGdETTqjspc_fv7JnW7QjT04-bBRn_licQ/edit#heading=h.5pbq95pboquk). Some of the links therein point to non-public resources (e.g. the data manifests) that will eventually be made publicly available.
